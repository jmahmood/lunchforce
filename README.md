What is Lunch Cloud?
--------------------
Lunch Cloud is a social grease that helps you invite co-workers to lunch.

It integrates with your system of choice (Email first; then Chatter / Twitter / Facebook ...) at the workplace.

You give it information about your food preferences, and you give it a day.  It will match you up with someone with similar tastes.

It will also give you one social task to do (check in at a restaurant, get a selfie, something simple to break the ice).

You can submit anonymous feedback afterwards to fine tune our system
