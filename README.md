What is Lunch Cloud?
--------------------
Lunch Cloud is corporate social lubricant that helps you meet co-workers by inviting them to lunch.

It integrates with your SNS of choice (Starting with email; then Chatter / Twitter / Facebook ...) at the workplace.

You give it information about your food preferences, and availability.  It will match you up with someone with similar tastes.

You can submit anonymous feedback afterwards to fine tune our system.
